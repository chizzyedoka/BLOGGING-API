# INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Blogging API documentation. This API allows you to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, manage user accounts, and perform various operations related to blogging. Whether you are building a personal blog, a content management system, or any application that requires blogging functionality, this API provides the tools you need to manage your content effectively.
You are required to build a blogging api. The general idea here is that the api has a general endpoint that shows a list of articles that have been created by different people, and anybody that calls this endpoint, should be able to read a blog created by them or other users.
